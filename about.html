      <br>
      Jessica Chuong was born on June 13. She lived in Union City for part of her childhood until she and her family moved to Milpitas at age 13 where she currently resides.
      Ever since she was young, she always had a creative mind. She always drew and doodled on paper whenever she could until she got her first digital drawing tablet,
      and started her digital art journey in 2016, specializing in digital illustration.
      She started at De Anza community college with the goal of transferring as an Animation and Digital Illustration major to San Jose State University (SJSU).
      She got rejected and changed her major to Digital Media Art (DMA). She considers that rejection as a blessing in disguise.
      <br>
      <br>
      She became a DMA student at SJSU in 2020 where she was able to explore many mediums of digital art.
      She was able to grow more as an artist and learned so much more than just animation in the DMA program.
      After broadening her artistic toolkit,
      she became interested in 3D as well as 2D. As expected,
      she now works with 2D illustrations and 3D models for her artwork.
