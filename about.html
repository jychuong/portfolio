      Jessica Chuong was born on June 13, 1998. She lived in Union City for part of her childhood until she and her family moved to Milpitas at age 13 where she currently resides. Ever since she was young, she always had a creative mind. She always drew and doodled on paper whenever she could until she got her first digital drawing tablet, and started her digital art journey in 2016, specializing in digital illustration. She started at De Anza community college with the goal of transferring as an Animation and Digital Illustration major to San Jose State University (SJSU). She got rejected and changed her major to Digital Media Art (DMA). Although she was sad at the time, she considered that rejection as a blessing in disguise. She became a DMA student at SJSU in 2020 where she was able to explore many mediums of digital art. She was able to grow more as an artist. After taking more classes and broadening her artistic toolkit, she became interested in 3D as well as 2D. As expected, she now works with 2D illustrations and 3D models for her artwork.

<p> <b> ARTIST STATEMENT </b>
</p>
<p> If there’s one thing I can do for this world, it is to make it cuter. I have always been drawn toward cute themes and it is one of my greatest motivations for art. It’s no surprise that many people like cute things but why do we find such things cute? What is the thing that makes something cute? A quick simple Google search would state that the common characteristics of cuteness are such as chubby and round features. Although, there are many such things that don’t share the same characteristics but are still considered cute. One of my goals as an artist is to explore this theme of what makes something cute. I want to produce art of what I think cuteness is and to see what other characteristics would fit.
</p>

<p> Including cute things, I’m also very interested in the combination of 2D and 3D.
  I always went back and forth between 2D and 3D work. I couldn’t choose which plane to focus so
   I decided to combine the two in a way that is appealing. How something 2D would work in a 3D space
   and how far does combining 2D objects can go before it becomes a 3D object are questions that intrigue me.
   I hope to continue to explore and expand on these themes and grow artistically.
